## 💾 Dataset

We use two standard datasets as follows:

**The [QMUL-Shoe-V2](http://sketchx.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/downloads/) dataset** contains 6730 sketches and 2000 photos. A total of 6051 sketches and 1800 photos were used to train the models, and the rest were used to test the models. 

**The [QMUL-Chair-V2](http://sketchx.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/downloads/) dataset** contains 2000 sketches and 400 photos. A total of 1275 sketches and 300 photos were used to train the models, and the rest were used to test the models.
